TODO: clean up inflow documentation


TODO: Read veg and microtopo from pklz files
- create these files
- save to pklz in 'veg' and 'coord' dirs?


TODO: test flags
- start with those listed in make_batches

TODO: Automate error checks
  - see check_fluxes notebook 
  - also see SVE_v1/figures



1. Patchy hydraulics.  
    See "convey" series
    Dig up initial outline
    Math in SVE_documentation/patchy.txt
    Start writing, or better lit review (i.e. clever papers from the 70s...)

2. Trial run on Xue micro topography

TODO: solve to ponding problem

TODO: test those side boundaries

TODO: write a version that interfaces well with
   - command line and not run in ||, just for debugging
   - more compatible with a single simulation call (interface with non  parallel)
 i.e. each stage separated out - write, submit, read...
 should stay current with any model changes.
      Batch write, read, etc. out of parallel, from command line.
      As simple as "if name == main" updates?

TODO: clean up dryG.for formatting strings.

TODO: plot_3D_functions need documenting, option to scale flow height

TODO: SVE_mass_check rename to plot_SVE_fluxes? plot_mass_check?

TODO: specify roughness? stop assuming manning? Add m to param file 

TODO:  update to new fortran (not fixed form)

TODO: not that multiple vegetation and topo types are not possible


TODO: edit function that reads in 'summary.txt'

TODO: salvage any clever patch code from the roughness project.

TODO: check that changing grid size doesn't break EVERYTHING

SPATIAL INFILTRATION 
- WATER RESOURCES

- CONTRIBUTING AREA

BULK RUNOFF COEFFICIENT FOR CONTRIBUTING AREA
-  HOW MUCH RAIN SHOWS UP AS RUNOFF


Analysis of runoff runoff units can help understand those things
- numerical cases can probe the boundaries
- unit based can fall apart
